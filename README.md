### GCN implementation in Keras
* The codes in this repo are based on the original code of paper: [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://github.com/tkipf/gcn).
* Two different data loading methods used by the author are also included in this repo (can be seen in the `train.py` file).
* The code is based on Keras and Tensorflow 2.0.
* The training codes are based on this [repo](https://github.com/YoungTimes/GNN/blob/master/GCN/train.py). Many thanks to YoungTimes.
